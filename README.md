# Yo, Check Out My Restaurant Web App! 🍜

Hey there! This is my solution for Module 5 of the Coursera *HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers* course. It’s a dynamic restaurant web app with a "Specials" tile that loads a random menu category using JavaScript and AJAX. Wanna see it in action? Let’s dive in!

👉 **Check it out here**: [https://your-username.github.io/Restaurant-Web-App/](https://your-username.github.io/Restaurant-Web-App/)

## What’s This Thing Do? 🤔

- Displays a responsive home page with Menu, Specials, and Map tiles.
- Clicking the "Specials" tile loads a random menu category (e.g., Lunch, Dinner, Sushi) using AJAX.
- Fetches menu data from a server and renders it dynamically.
- Clean, Bootstrap-powered UI with a mobile-friendly navbar.
- Click the logo (or Home link on mobile) to return to the home page.

## How to Run It 🚀

Wanna try it yourself? Here’s the deal:

1. Grab the code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Restaurant-Web-App.git
   ```

2. Jump into the folder:
   ```bash
   cd Restaurant-Web-App
   ```

3. Fire up a local server with Browser Sync (it’s the vibe):
   ```bash
   browser-sync start --server --files "*.html, *.js, *.css"
   ```

4. Open Chrome, hit `http://localhost:3000`, and:
   - Click the "Specials" tile to see a random menu category.
   - Return to the home page via the logo (desktop) or Home link (mobile).
   - Repeat to check the random category magic!

## What’s Inside? 📂

Just a few files:
- `index.html`: The main page with navbar and content container.
- `snippets/home-snippet.html`: Home page tiles (Menu, Specials, Map).
- `js/script.js`: Handles random category logic and AJAX requests.
- `js/ajax-utils.js`: AJAX utility for server requests.
- `css/styles.css`: Custom styles for a polished look.
- `css/bootstrap.min.css`: Bootstrap for responsive design.

## Tools I Used 🛠️

- **HTML5**: Structure for the web app.
- **CSS3**: Styling with Bootstrap and custom CSS.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic logic for random category selection.
- **jQuery**: Simplifies DOM manipulation and AJAX.
- **Bootstrap**: Responsive grid and components.
- **Browser Sync**: Smooth local testing.
